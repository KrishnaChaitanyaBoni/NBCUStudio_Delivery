For installing the iOS executable application file, 
1. Host the '.ipa' file along with '.plist' provided,  into a server
2. Before hosting the files, you need to make few changes in the '.plist' file.
3. Replace the following url "http://yourServerIPHere/hostedPath/NBCUStudioApp.ipa" with the respective server address and the folder path where the '.ipa' file is being hosted. (For example "http://2.1.1.110/applications/NBCUStudioApp.ipa" would be the pattern of the url where (2.1.1.110 is the server ip, and 'applications' is the folder in which the '.ipa' has been hosted.)
4. Create an 'index.html' file and host it into the same folder level as of the '.ipa' file, in which the full path to '.plist' file have to be included. 
5. Start the server, and access the url through the iOS device's browser to install the application.
